    <h4>Assignment 0 - 9/23/16</h4>
    <p>
      I have never used GitHub before and figuring it out isn't too terrible.
      The worst part is probably just uploading my page to the ENGR site.
      This assignment helped me to learn GitHub and the ENGR uploading procedures.
      The HTML I mostly knew and just looked up anything I needed. The resources on the web
      were the best sources for finding info on HTML and GitHub.
